# GPTPerEval

In the rapidly evolving field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), large-scale language models like ChatGPT have demonstrated remarkable success in a multitude of tasks, ranging from text generation to complex reasoning. However, the bulk of this success is predominantly observed in English language applications. The performance and capabilities of these models in handling non-English languages, especially less-resourced ones such as Persian, remain significantly underexplored.

In our endeavor with this project, we aim to address the existing research gap by conducting an in-depth evaluation of ChatGPT's effectiveness in Persian Natural Language Processing tasks. Central to our investigation is the comparative analysis where ChatGPT's performance will be benchmarked against leading Persian NLP models. This comparative approach is designed to shed light on the unique strengths and potential limitations of ChatGPT when dealing with the intricacies of Persian language processing.

Key to our study is assessing the quality of language generation by ChatGPT in Persian. We aim to examine the fluency, coherence, and cultural appropriateness of the generated text, especially its adaptability to syntactic structures, and contextual nuances. This aspect is crucial in understanding how ChatGPT, trained predominantly on English datasets, manages the transition to handling Persian with its distinct linguistic characteristics. Furthermore, a detailed error analysis will be conducted, which focuses on understanding the nature of mistakes, whether they are syntactic errors, cultural misunderstandings, or issues related to language nuances.

Through "GPTPerEval", our objective is to cultivate a thorough understanding of the capabilities and boundaries of ChatGPT in handling Persian language tasks. The insights garnered from this study are anticipated to be instrumental in guiding the development of future NLP models, not just for Persian but also for other less-represented languages.  While our research is a modest contribution to the expansive field of NLP, it aims to provide valuable perspectives that could inform more culturally nuanced and linguistically adaptive approaches in language model development, particularly for academic and educational purposes.
